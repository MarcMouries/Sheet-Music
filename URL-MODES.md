# URL Modes for Sheet Music Index

The index page now supports multiple URL modes for easy sharing and navigation.

## 1. View All Tunes (Default)
**URL:** `index.html`

Shows all tunes in the collection with full filtering capabilities.

## 2. Category View
**URL:** `index.html?category=<category-name>`

Shows only tunes from a specific category.

**Examples:**
- `index.html?category=wedding` - Show only wedding music
- `index.html?category=Celtic/Irish` - Show Irish tunes
- `index.html?category=Classical` - Show classical pieces
- `index.html?category=Jazz` - Show jazz standards

## 3. Tune Detail View
**URL:** `index.html?tune=<tune-slug>`

Shows a detailed page for a single tune with:
- Large preview image (if available)
- Full metadata (composer, country, style, key, difficulty)
- Tags
- Action buttons (View PDF, Play MIDI, Watch Video)
- Copy Link button for easy sharing

**How tune slugs work:**
- The tune title is converted to a URL-safe slug
- All lowercase
- Non-alphanumeric characters replaced with hyphens
- Multiple hyphens collapsed to one

**Examples:**
- `index.html?tune=gary-owen` - Gary Owen tune detail
- `index.html?tune=the-butterfly` - The Butterfly tune detail
- `index.html?tune=manha-de-carnaval` - Manhã De Carnaval detail
- `index.html?tune=happy-birthday` - Happy Birthday detail

## 4. Quick Filters
These are accessed via buttons on the page but also support URL parameters:

**URL:** `index.html?filter=<filter-name>`

**Examples:**
- `index.html?filter=christmas` - Show Christmas songs
- `index.html?filter=top10` - Show top 10 most famous tunes

## 5. Combining Parameters (Future Enhancement)
While not yet fully supported, the system is designed to eventually support combinations like:
- `index.html?category=Jazz&difficulty=3` - Jazz tunes at intermediate level
- `index.html?country=Ireland&style=jig` - Irish jigs
