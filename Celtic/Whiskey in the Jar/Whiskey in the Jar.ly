% "glockenspiel"			works, but not suited for accompaniment
% "string ensemble 1"			works, quite loud
% "orchestral strings"			works, softer

% "church organ"			works, very loud and clear
% "flute"				works, good for melody
% "recorder"				works, good for melody
% "choir aahs"				no warning, but no sound
% "banjo"				no warning, but no sound
